## General Information
Project Title: An evaluative framework of explainable machine learning methods

Purpose: To build a quantitive, objective framework for the evaluation of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).

How does this code support the project?
This code was written to create the algorithms which the proposed framework would evaluate. The code classifies species based on extracted features from opto-acoustic recordings of aphids and beetles and also uses the environmental data collected.

## Repository contents:
1. RFC.ipynb

      a. Random forest classifier notebook
  
2. SVM.ipynb

      a. Support vector machine notebook

## Methodology 
1. Both notebooks have the same data preprocessing:

      a. Importing basic librares and the dataset
  
      b. Dropping unneeded features from the dataset
  
      c. Handling missing values
  
      d. Removing species object classes with low instances
  
      e. Scaling
  
      f. Feature selection
  
      g. Data splitting for training and testing
  
      h. Data imbalance handling
  
2. Key difference between the two notebooks is the machine learning model used: Random forest classifier and support vector machine model.
